      <p> Staying organised significantly aids in reducing stress as it reduces clutter, creates a sense of control, helps prioritise tasks, promotes productivity, and helps establish a school-life balance. Staying organised isnâ€™t just about being organised in terms of tasks but also your environment. If your environment is messy, digitally or physically, it is likely to affect your work performance when completing homework as you are likely to be searching for misplaced items, or finding an email in a full inbox. Having a clear and organised space will also help reduce mental clutter and evoke a sense of calmness.
    </p>

    <p>Creating systems and routines, for instance a to-do list preferably with deadlines, will help you to prioritise tasks which need to be completed within a certain time frame, meaning you can focus on the higher prioritised tasks first and then work on the others. Additionally, this will reduce the amount of stress which one can develop when procrastinating as you are likely to not leave things to the last minute.</p>

    <p>To further organise your tasks you could place all of your tasks in a calendar alongside your personal events/tasks. This will help you to visualise when you have too much going on or too little and will help you to rearrange and plan a good time where you can complete a task, to have a balanced lifestyle, and reduce stress.
