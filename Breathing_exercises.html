      <p> Usually when stressed or anxious people tend to breathe using their shoulders rather than their diaphragm as a result of changing oneâ€™s breathing pattern. Breathing exercises aid in returning focus away from using your shoulders to your diaphragm. Using your abdomen to breathe and breathing in a controlled manner helps control your nervous system and can cause physiological changes such as lowering your blood pressure and heart rate, improving your immune system, and balancing the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide within your blood. Overall it promotes relaxation. </p>

      <p>Below is a video which you can use to follow along an example of a breathing exercise.</p>
