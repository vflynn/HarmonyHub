      <p> As students progress through their years at school their workload increases more and more. In some cases this workload can become too much causing the majority of students to stress and develop mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and burn out. These issues can affect people not only mentally but also socially and physically. For instance, these issues can have a significant, negative toll on your body and one may lose friendships and other relationships due to isolation. </p>

        <p>There are many ways in which you can prevent or reduce the chance of developing these mental health conditions or overall reducing and controlling your stress levels. Some ways in which you could do this is by taking part in some relaxational activities and/or hobbies. This website provides 4 activities/hobbies/things for you to try and hopefully implement into your life. Breathing exercises, mandala drawing, staying organised, and listening to relaxing playlists.
